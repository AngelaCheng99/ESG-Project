## Research

### Idea 1: Look for key targets and metrics

General feeling: GRI (Global Reporting Index) is a recurring theme, so is TCFD Metrics and Targets. 
Pros: 
- Align with goal-tracknig purpose/principle in work
Cons: 
- Hard to standardize across providers (fragemented pieces). Might as well read the pdf.
- The only thing which is more standardized is reporting on E (Environment). TCFD Metrics and Targets are the closest with some stats available for comparison between providers. But if looking for this specifically, then might as well search in the pdf (no need for python) 
- Example standardized stats: fund exposure, carbon/emission footprint

Would be interesting to identify what are the common stats available across providers.
- Extract all the goals from each provider
- Compare the goals with each other to see if they are similar
Challenging: some providers give ad hoc stats and do not publish progress on the goals using numbers (more using text) and can change stats reported from year to year (lack of consistency)
